2PING - A BI-DIRECTIONAL PING UTILITY


https://www.finnie.org/software/2ping/


About

2ping is a bi-directional ping utility. It uses 3-way pings (akin to TCP
SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) and after-the-fact state comparison between a 2ping
listener and a 2ping client to determine which direction packet loss
occurs.


Installation

2ping requires Python 3 version 3.4 or higher.

To install:

    sudo python3 setup.py install

Python 3 stdlib is the only requirement for base functionality, but
2ping can utilize the following modules if available:

-   dnspython for --srv
-   netifaces for --listen --all-interfaces
-   pycrypto for --encrypt


Usage

Please see the 2ping manpage for invocation options, but in short, start
a listener on the far end:

    2ping --listen

And run 2ping on the near end, connecting to the far end listener:

    2ping $LISTENER

Where "$LISTENER" is the name or IP address of the listener.
